What would you choose?

-   Spend 20 hours building a neural network from scratch by yourself,
    using your limited knowledge of the technology and limited coding
    skills. OR
-   Listen to 20 hours of podcasts and online courses, doing
    examples prepared by expert teachers.

Most of us, most of the time, choose the second option. It seems like
the better idea. If someone *instructs us* about something, of course
it’s a more effective path to knowledge than if we randomly stab in the
dark.

But in fact, sometimes real experience beats any kind of structured
learning. A self-motivated experiment, throwing yourself head-first into
a field of study, often beats a carefully planned curriculum. This is
why, if you want to learn a new language, it’s a thousand times more
effective to *move to the country where that language is spoken* than to
take a course. Yes, even though your experience will be chaotic, and
there will be no system to the way you learn the language—you’ll learn
nevertheless, and much quicker.

That’s what I mean by “doing the real thing”. This tends to be more
uncomfortable and scary. We often lie to ourself: “It’d be stupid to do
X right now. I should first read this book about it.”

No. Stop it. Just do the thing. Don’t do some fake proxy thing, like
reading up on it, or setting up your environment, or buying exercise
equipment. Do it now, with what you have and what you know.

It’s a better use of your time, in most cases.

And yes, it’s more uncomfortable. It’s scary (because with the real
thing, it’s possible *to fail*).
