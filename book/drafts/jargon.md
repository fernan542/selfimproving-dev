I dislike jargon. But I also use it. There is something about new language that we humans want to use it.

> We're doing good progress, modulo the performance story.

The following are _not_ all the words you'll need to know. They are often not even the most important ones. (For example, it's more important for you to know what a class is, than what a developer means when she says "stack".) In fact, they are precisely the words that are on the outskirts of programming. They're much more likely to be said in a meeting or in a bug description, than in documentation.

* Modulo
* Story
* Perpendicular (problems)
* PR / CL
* LGTM
* DRY
* API
* Sync (meeting)
* Build
* CI/CD
* Deployment
* Framework / Library / Package
* Front end (not just client side, but sometime's server's front-end) vs backend
* Stack (incl. full stack)
* Frame (both UI and stack trace)
