Software development is not *just* programming. One of the things I
didn’t understand as my younger self is that you can’t just plop out a
project and wait until the world finds it, understands it, and starts
using it *en masse*.

Example: Linus Torvalds - Linux.

* Marketing
    * In 19xx, an unknown finish developer named Linus Torvalds sent an email to mailing list X about his new project. ... Linux.
    * In 200x, an unknown x developer named notch wrote to TigSource. ... Minecraft.
    * In 201x, an unknown x developer named y wrote a concise readme on GitHub. ... Vue? Npm? 
    * All of these are example of marketing. Marketing isn't just ads. Marketing isn't evil. Marketing doesn't make things more expensive (it can make them less expensive).
    * The key to marketing is in the word itself. Market-ing. Getting some goods to some market. Analogy with apples and a marketplace.
