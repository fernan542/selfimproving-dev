Just read the whole API. If it’s an API you use often, read it often. The whole thing, not just the stuff you’re currently using.

Same for programming languages.

It’s like knowing all the little buttons on your washing machine. It’s boring to read the manual, but you might get a lot better results if you knew what all of them are actually doing. Maybe there’s a mode that’s better for you than the one you’re using right now?
