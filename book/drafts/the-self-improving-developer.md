A career in programming can look like this:

-   Learn C++ at university.
-   Obtain a Computer Science degree.
-   Get a job as a C++ Software Engineer.

But in most cases, it doesn’t.

In most cases, according to my reading of the best science available to
me, programmers kind of stumble upon their career.

I’m one of those people. I did program from an early age, enjoyed
building software in high school, and even went to get a Computer
Science degree. But I abandoned that path, and became a journalist
instead. Smart move, I know.

Well, code never really left my horizon, and in the years since I left
the path, I still programmed and educated myself in the arts of software
engineering.

Today, I’m working in Silicon Valley. I program every day, and teach
others to do so, too. I’ve found the perfect niche for someone like me,
a technical person with a knack for explaining stuff.

Programming has enabled me to go from a career of a
potentially struggling journalist in a small European country to a
person who can work and live anywhere, and even execute on some of the
idealistic visions of his teenage years.

Don’t get me wrong: programming is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s
hard and it’s one of those things that you can’t ever learn completely.
But it is definitely an enabler, in today’s world.

This blog is for people who already taught themselves to program to some
degree, but would love to improve their skills and their understanding
of technology. It is an attempt to bridge the gap between the *“I can
write code”* level and the *“I understand reified types”* level of
software development.
